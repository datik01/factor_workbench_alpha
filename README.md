Factor Workbench is an institutional-grade, asynchronous quantitative backtesting dashboard built with **Shiny for Python**. It empowers users to simulate cross-sectional multi-factor equity strategies across major indices (Russell 2000, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100) and leverages a **local Multi-Agent AI (Ollama)** architecture to autonomously generate hypotheses, analyze performance, and evaluate portfolio risk.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The application seamlessly decouples heavy quantitative workloads and AI inference from the front-end user interface using a robust background execution thread and real-time polling.

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration (`agents.py`)**:
    - **Hypothesis Generator**: Formulates an initial market thesis based on selected parameters (e.g., Value + Momentum).
    - **Quant Analyst**: Programmatically interfaces with the backtest tool (`tools.py`), executing the strategy and translating the raw JSON metrics into a readable performance report.
    - **Risk Manager**: Critiques the Quant Analyst's report, summarizing structural drawdowns and assessing the validity of the strategy constraint variables.

2. **Institutional Data Integrity (`constituents/`)**:
    - Avoids survivorship bias by deploying a dynamic **Point-In-Time (PIT)** filter.
    - A dedicated SEC EDGAR N-PORT parser natively scrapes the historical holdings of proxies like `IWM` (Russell 2000) or `SPY` (S&P 500) to ensure the engine only targets assets exactly as they existed on the historical rebalance date.

3. **High-Performance Backtest Engine (`tools.py`)**:
    - Fully vectorized multi-factor arrays evaluating Momentum, Mean Reversion, Volatility, Volume profiles, and Size.
    - Dynamic benchmark mapping ensures strategy parameters are cleanly isolated and tracked accurately against their true proxy ETF baseline.

4. **Responsive UI & Threading**:
    - Custom dark-theme aesthetics with dynamic Bootstrap 5 CSS mapping.
    - Completely asynchronous quantitative loops utilizing native Python Threading.
    - Embedded UI Modals provide granular, smooth, sub-second (Zeno-asymptotic) percentage loader sweeps, eliminating browser locks entirely.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone & Virtual Environment Configuration**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/factor-workbench.git
    cd factor-workbench/08_function_calling/TOOL_v2
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install Associated Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Ensure you have `shiny`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, `requests`, and `beautifulsoup4`.*

3. **Provide API Tokens**:
    In `/08_function_calling/TOOL_v2/.env`, export your Polygon key to handle the caching backend:
    ```bash
    POLYGON_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

4. **Run the AI Local Node**:
    The system relies entirely on local, private inference via Ollama. Ensure your Ollama node is actively hosting the defined model (e.g., Gemma).
    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```

5. **Initialize application**:
    ```bash
    shiny run --reload app.py
    ```

## 🧪 Testing Protocol

The platform explicitly tests mathematical mapping integrations utilizing `unittest.mock`. 
Run the integrated test suite locally utilizing:
```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test_engine.py
```
This rapidly simulates execution paths, explicitly testing scaling nodes, `nonlocal` backend thread bindings, and structural matrix alignment (Sharpe, Returns) validating exact mappings between the baseline Index APIs and the backtest framework.
